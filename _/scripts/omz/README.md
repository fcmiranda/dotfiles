How to Use:

    Make it executable: chmod +x install.sh

    Run it: ./install.sh

    Important: Carefully read the output of the script. It will tell you whether it was able to successfully refresh your OMZ environment.

    If the script tells you to open a new terminal or run source ~/.zshrc, then do so.

    Test: Type omz in your terminal.
